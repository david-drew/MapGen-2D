# MapGen-2D
### Version 0.1

This is a prototype 2D procedural map generation app.  It's built in Godot 4.5 gdscript.

It has a UI to help test map details, and should be modular enough to work in both 2D and 3D projects.

## To Do
* Switching between generated maps (when applicable) is slow because there's no caching.
* Spawn points not integrated.
* Clue and story system not integrated (might be best to keep separate).
